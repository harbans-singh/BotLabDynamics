# Manual Test Cases for Drone Telemetry Simulator

## 1. Drone Creation and Initialization

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC1.1 | Start the application | The main window opens with all telemetry fields populated. |
| TC1.2 | Observe the Drone ID, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Heading, Speed, Battery, and GPS Fix fields | Drone ID is shown, coordinates default to New Delhi, battery is 100%, GPS Fix is "3D Fix". |

---

## 2. Start/Stop Simulation

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC2.1 | Click "Start Simulation" | The button changes to "Stop Simulation", telemetry values (lat/lon/alt/heading/speed/battery) update every 500ms. |
| TC2.2 | Click "Stop Simulation" | Simulation stops, values freeze, button changes to "Start Simulation". |

---

## 3. Movement Strategies

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC3.1 | With simulation running, select "Hover" from the Movement Strategy dropdown | Drone's position changes minimally, speed remains low. |
| TC3.2 | Select "Random Walk" from the dropdown | Drone's position changes more significantly, speed increases, heading changes more. |

---

## 4. Battery Drain

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC4.1 | Start simulation and observe battery | Battery percentage decreases slowly over time. |
| TC4.2 | When battery drops to 20% or below | A warning is shown, battery bar turns yellow or red. |

---

## 5. Failure Simulation

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC5.1 | Click "Simulate Failure" | GPS Fix changes to "No Fix", battery drains rapidly, status shows "Failure Mode Active". |
| TC5.2 | Click "Reset Failure" | GPS Fix returns to "3D Fix", battery drain returns to normal, status shows "Normal Operation". |

---

## 6. GPS Fix Status

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC6.1 | During normal simulation | GPS Fix is "3D Fix" (green). |
| TC6.2 | During failure simulation | GPS Fix is "No Fix" (red). |

---

## 7. Logger Functionality

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC7.1 | Start and stop the application | A new log file is created in the `logs` folder in the build directory. |
| TC7.2 | Perform actions (start/stop simulation, simulate failure, change strategy) | Each action is logged with a timestamp and log level. |

---

## 8. UI Status and Warnings

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC8.1 | Let battery drop below 20% | Warning dialog appears, status bar shows "Low Battery". |
| TC8.2 | Simulate GPS loss | Warning dialog appears, status bar shows "GPS Fix Lost". |

---

## 9. Application Stability

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC9.1 | Start/stop simulation repeatedly | No crashes or freezes. |
| TC9.2 | Switch strategies during simulation | No crashes, strategy changes reflected in movement. |
| TC9.3 | Simulate and reset failure multiple times | No crashes, system recovers as expected. |

---

## 10. Default Location

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| TC10.1 | Start the application | Latitude is 28.6139, Longitude is 77.2090 (New Delhi). |
